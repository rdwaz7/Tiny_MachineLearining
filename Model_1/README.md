## Introduction
This our first training model for AI Course, This model is done based on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

## What is the "Color Prediction Model"?

This our first training model, it classifies the input image according to its colour.
It takes the path of the image, and then predict the colour
