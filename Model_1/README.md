## Introduction
This our first training model for AI Course, This model is done based on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

## What is the "Color Prediction Model"?

This our first training model, it classifies the input image according to its colour.
It takes the path of the image, and then predict the colour 
The predicted colors (The labels):
* Yellow
* Blue
* Red
* Orange
* Black

## How the model work
### Step 1: Gather
Gather and group your examples into classes, or categories, that you want the computer to learn.
#### Step 2: Train
Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.
##### Step 3: Export
Export your model for your projects: sites, apps, and more. You can download your model or host it online for free.

## With the help of the libraries, give the model a test image, let the model predict the colour then finally, the model answers.
